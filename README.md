# RJava Project

The goal of this project is to develop a Java application that connects to an R Script in order to conduct data analysis on the ISLR data sets. 
As of now, ISLR data sets may be imported in from R and the raw data may be viewed. In addition, summary statistics for these datasets may be viewed.

### Technologies

The project utilizes R version 3.3, Java and Angular JS. R version 3.3 was used as there were issues utilizing Rserve with the latest version of R (3.5).
